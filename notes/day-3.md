## Administrative Tasks

### Rename Server

Traditionally, you would rename a server by editing two files (`/etc/hostname` and `/etc/hosts`) and then rebooting. However, the modern and recommended way is to use the `hostnamectl` command:

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <new-hostname>
````

For cloud servers, the hostname might change after a reboot. To prevent this, edit `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg` and set:

```
preserve_hostname: true
```

Changing the `preserve_hostname` setting determines whether the systemâ€™s hostname remains as configured or is overridden by cloud provider information during a reboot.


### Set Time Zone

- **Check current setting:**
    
    ```bash
    timedatectl
    ```
    
- **List available time zones:**
    
    ```bash
    timedatectl list-timezones
    ```
    
- **Set new time zone (e.g., Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh):**
    
    ```bash
    sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh
    ```
    
- **Confirm the change:**
    
    ```bash
    timedatectl
    ```

**Warning:** Changing the time zone affects the scheduling of tasks and the timestamping of log files in `/var/log`. A change will result in a noticeable jump in the recorded dates and times.


## Lessons and Notes

- **Global vs. Local Changes:**  
    A global change affects all users, whereas a local change affects only one user.
    
- **User Types:**
    
    - **Root:** A powerful superuser who can execute any command at any level, making global and local changes.
    - **Sudoer:** A regular user permitted to use `sudo`, often with privileges close to root.
    - **Regular User:** A standard user with limited privileges.
- **Password Input:**  
    When running `passwd`, note that no characters will be displayed as you type the password. Always create a strong password and make this a habit as part of your system hardening practices.
    
- **User Groups:**  
    The **wheel** group serves a similar function as the **sudo** group but is typically used in CentOS, Fedora, RHEL, and BSD systems, while the **sudo** group is used in Ubuntu and Debian-based distributions.
    
- **Shell Access with sudo:**
    
    - `sudo -i` creates a new shell with the full environment of the root user.
    - `sudo -s` launches a new shell with root privileges but retains the current user's environment.
